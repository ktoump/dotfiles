# My i3wm setup
*i3 window manager*
### A head-up to what install.sh does:
* Symlinks i3's main config (you don't say?)...
* ...termite's config (obviously if you don't use that one don't run the script)...
* ...and dunst's
Otherwise everything is read from here.

### Dependencies:
* [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)
* [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks)

* [dunst](https://github.com/knopwob/dunst)

### Todo:

* add [taverner](https://github.com/Earnestly/taverner)
* have seen a script to categorize pdf collections with zathura, but i can't seem to remember the name, gotta look it up l8r.
